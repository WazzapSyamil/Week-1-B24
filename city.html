<p><strong>Shah Alam</strong> is a city and the state capital of <strong>Selangor, Malaysia</strong>  and situated within the <strong>Petaling District</strong> and a small portion of the neighbouring <strong>Klang District. Shah Alam</strong>  replaced Kuala Lumpur as the capital city of the state of Selangor in 1978 due to Kuala Lumpur's incorporation into a Federal Territory in 1974. Shah Alam was the first planned city in Malaysia after independence from Britain in 1957.</p>

<p> Many other monuments, buildings and even a street are named after the late <em>Sultan</em>. Shah Alam was opened in 1963 with the purpose of making it the new administrative centre of Selangor, replacing Kuala Lumpur which was made a Federal Territory on 1 February 1974. With the consent of the Sultan, Shah Alam was proclaimed the capital of Selangor on 7 December 1978 with an initial area of 41.68 km2, and administrated by a municipal council</p>
